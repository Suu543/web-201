# 04. Traversing the DOM

### Previous Section

In the previous sections, we’ve seen how to use the built-in DOM API methods of the document object to access HTML elements by ID, class, tag name, and query selectors.

We know that the DOM is basically a tree of nodes. The document node is the root (or trunk of the tree), and every other node (such as elements, comments, text, etc) are the numerous branches.

But sometimes this is not enough.

### Let's get crackin'

Sometimes, you’ll want to move through the DOM without specifying each and every element beforehand. Learning how to navigate up and down the DOM tree and move from node to node (or branch to branch) is essential to becoming an awesome developer and understanding how to work with JavaScript and HTML.

In this section, we will go over how to traverse the DOM (also known as walking or navigating the DOM) with parent, child, and sibling properties.

Enjoy!

## Traversing the DOM - Introduction

`A parent of any node` is the node `immediately above it`. There are 2 main methods we can use to get the parent node

- `parentNode`
- `parentElement`

`The child of a node` is the node `immediately below it`. Nodes beyond one level of nesting are called `descendents`

`A sibling of a node` is any node in `the same level`. Sibling nodes don't have to be of the same type.

Why we traverse

Let's say you're chilling at home, minding your own business. You open the pantry, wanting a brew of freshly ground coffee.

But then...

You realize you forgot to buy some at the shops (sigh)!

Don't stress - You've got an idea

You have a friendly neighbor who is an avid coffee enthusiast like you.

One problem: you need to get to your neighbors house (hint hint ... you want to move around the DOM).

What's the fastest and most efficient way to get there?

1. Walk from your house to their house (since you already know their address remember)?

or

2. Pull out your phone, swipe your unlock code, look up their address on Google maps, then walk according to the directions Google gives you?

Traversing the DOM vs Accessing the DOM

If you walk directly from your house to their house, you’re doing the equivalent of traversing the DOM (aka: getting one element from a neighboring element in the DOM).

If you choose option 2, by looking up their address on Google, you’re doing the equivalent of `document.querySelector` or the other DOM access methods to find elements.

Which method is more efficient?

It depends.

Option 1 can be better in some cases - in a simple DOM tree, its much easier to walk over to other elements than it is getting too complicated. However, not always. What if your friend’s house is located in some downtown alley in some random street (i.e. what if the node or element you’re looking for is heavily nested within other elements)? As you guessed it, option number 2 is the better solution.

## Why do we need to traverse the DOM?

- The DOM API allows us to do anything to elements and their content (usually via JavaScript). But, we first need a way to reach the corresponding DOM node
- In the previous sections we discussed how we can use the DOM API to access HTML elements
  - ID, CLASS, TAG NAME, SELECTOR API
- We've learnt that the DOM is structured as a tree of Nodes
- Often we want to perform actions on elements that have `relationships` to each other. To do this, we need a way of moving from one node to another node, that is, a way of traversing the DOM.

## The 3 most important objects in the DOM

1. window
2. document
3. HTML

```javascript
// Why would we ever do this?
let globalWindowObject = window;
globalWindowObject 

// this seems pointless
let documentNode = document;

// Global Properties
window;
document;

let HTMLElement = document.documentElement;
HTMLElement
```

## Parent, Child and ...

Our DOM will start to branch out and get interesting. At this point, we have several ways of getting around. These methods can be limiting, because sometimes we don't know that we're looking for

- querySelector
- querySelectorAll

What helps us in this that knowing that all of our elements in the DOM have at least ONE combination of parents, children, and sibling to rely on.

## Parent Node

To help us move up and down the DOM tree, we have a few methods we can use

- firstChild
- lastChild
- previousSibling
- nextSibling
- parentNode
- children

```javascript
// Elements Tab을 먼저 보고 == $0을 찾는다
let h2 = $0;
h2

h2.parentNode;
// <div id="wrapper-2">..</div>
h2.parentNode.parentNode;
// <main>...</main>
h2.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode;
// <body>...</body>

let div = document.getElementByTagName('div')[0];
div
// <div id="wrapper">...</div>

let grandParent = div.parentNode.parentNode;
grandParent
// <body>...</body>

grandParent.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
```

## Siblings in the DOM

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ShvLMVE-Yrt6j9ddU3oDnA.png)

```javascript
let p = $0;

p.previousSibling;
// <h2 class="joke">...</h2>

p.previousSibling.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
```

## firstChild, lastChild and children

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*EVmQGs0sHvJz0OxkvcwLsw.png)

```javascript
let bodyChildren = document.body.children;
bodyChildren;
// script는 live server임
// HTMLCollection(2) [main, script]

for (let i = 0; i < bodyChildren.length; i++) {
	let child = bodyChildren[i];
    child.style.border = '5px solid red';
}

let h1 = document.getElementByTagName('h1');
// h1;
// HTMLCollection[h1]

h1[0].children;
// HTMLCollection[]

h1[0].firstChild;
// "welcome"
h1[0].lastChild
// "welcome"
h1[0].firstElementChild;
// null
```

## Children Property

## Children

Elements that are directly nested below another element

An HTML element may have many levels of other elements nested under it. All of these nested elements are called `descendants` of our starting element. A special descendant is an element `one nesting level below` from the given node. 

- child element

A child element can only have one parent.

We know that all text in your HTML is also a `text node` in the DOM

`<h1>I'm a child text node</h1>`

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*pTl8YEOVVzS3p5bCxquDbg.png)

```javascript
// childNodes (nodeList) vs children (HTMLCollection)
let ul = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];

// childNodes will return a node list which means it's going to include all the text and character, breaks, and returns in our document
ul.childNodes;
NodeList(7) [text, li, text, li, text, li, text]
```

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*R8bVUOT8OiL6OBmMK438eA.png)

```javascript
let ul = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];

ul.firstElementChild.style.backgroundColor = "red";

let ulChildren = ul.children;
ulChildren;
// HTMLCollection(3) [li, li, li]

for (let i = 0; i < ulChildren.length; i++) {
	let li = ulChildren[i];
    li.style.border = '5px solid red';
}
```

## node types

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <!-- these are my cool list items -->
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
            <li>Item 4</li>
            <li>Item 5</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

1. return the number of Element nodes within the `<ul>` tag
2. return the number of nodes (any type) within the `<ul>` tag

```javascript
let list = document.getElementsByTagName("ul")[0];
list;
// <ul>..</ul>
// solution #1
list.children.length;
// 5
list.chilElementCount;
// 5

// solution #2
list.childNodes.length;
// 13
```

## Siblings

Elements that share the same parent

Siblings are like brother and sister ... in the same tree level

Siblings do not have to be of the same type (just like your brother or sister)

Nodes higher than a sibling are `ancestors` and those below it are `descendants`

## Working with sibling methods

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <!-- these are my cool list items -->
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li style="background-color: green;">Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
let ul = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];
ul;
// <ul>...</ul>
ul.children;
// HTMLCollection(3) [li, li, li]
let middle = ul.children[1];
// middle.previousSibling;
// it's going to include all the text and character, breaks, and returns in our document 
// 하지만 나는 element만 가져오고 싶음
// middle.previousSibling.previousSibling;
middle.previousElementSibling.style.backgroundColor = "pink";
middle.nextElementSibling.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

## Conclusion

Have learnt how to access nodes and walk the DOM tree

- parent
- child - sibling - child

### Questions

1. The DOM can be represented as a tree of nodes, and often we want to walk around these branches.

- Which directions can we traverse the DOM? 

- Upwards + Sideways + Downwards



2. What are nodes often compared to

- The nodes in the DOM are referred to as `parents`, `children`, and `siblings`, depending on their relation to other nodes.



3. What is true about this block of code?

```html
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Keep going</h1>
        <h2>Stay motivated</h2>
    </div>
    <p> Slowly slowly catch a monkey </p>
</body>

// <h1> and <h2> are siblings
```



4. What is similarity between  *sibling* methods and *children* methods? 

- Both `siblings` and `children` have a set of methods that allows us to traverse all nodes, and a set of methods that allows us to traverse only element nodes.



5. Which of the below methods is **NOT** a valid method to find a child of a node?

- childrenNodes



6. When you access the ***children\*** property on a parent, you get returned a collection of the child elements the parent has.

```html
<body>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
</body>

If we use the children property on the <ul> tag, we will get returned to us: 
HTMLCollection(2) [li, li]
    
Question: is this collection the same as a JavaScript Array?
- No
```



7. What is the difference between the `childNodes` and `children` property? 

- `.children` is a property of an Element. Only Elements have `.children`, and these children are all of type Element.
- However, `.childNodes` is a property of Node, and this means that `.childNodes` can contain any node.



8. Looking at the below code, what will `document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].firstChild` return? 

   ```html
   <body>
       <ul>
           <li>Item 1</li>
           <li>Item 2</li>
       </ul>
       
       <script>
   		let node = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].firstChild
   		console.log(node); // a #text node    
       </script>
   </body>
   ```



9. Looking at the below code, what will `document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].children` return? 

   ```html
   <body>
       <ul>
           <li>Item 1</li>
           <li>Item 2</li>
       </ul>
       
       <script>
       	let nodes = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].children;
           // It will return both <li>Item 1</li> and <li>Item 2</li>
       </script>
   </body>
   ```



10. Looking at the below code, what will `document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].firstElementChild` return? 

    ```html
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
        </ul>
        
        <script>
        	let node = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].firstElementChild;
            // <li>Item 1</li>
        </script>
    </body>
    ```



11. Looking at the below code, what will `document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].childNodes.length`return? 

    ```html
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
        </ul>
        
        <script>
        	let node = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].childNodes.length;
            // length --> 5
        </script>
    </body>
    ```
