# Nodes

Every item in the DOM TREE

Every HTML document is made up of a tree of HTML nodes <p><h><div>

Each node can have HTML attributes

Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text

Most nodes have a specific meaning / purpose <title>

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>What are Nodes</title>
    </head>
</html>
```

# Nodes in action

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>What are Nodes</title>
    </head>
</html>
```

왜 #text elements가 DOM에 포함되는 것일까?

Any newline or space are valid characters (just like letters or numbers) and as such they have to become part of the DOM

There are two exceptions:

1. spaces and newlines above the <head> are ignored
2. spaces and newlines below </body> are removed and placed inside the <body> element

# childNodes - How do we see Nodes?

```javascript
let head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')
head;
// HTMLCollection [head] - Only consists of one node
// line break and new line doesn't show up

// childNodes를 이용하면 확인할 수 있다 (We'll be able to see every single node)
head[0].childNodes;
// NodeList(6) [text, title, text, comment, text, script]
// script: Live Server injects this script automatically into my document without us having to write it off
```

# Creating Different Nodes

There's a lot of 'stuff' in the DOM <p> <h1> <div> comments text etc

NODES - We have different types of Nodes

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>What are Nodes</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is an Element Node</h1>
        This is a Text Node, all by its lonesome self
        <!-- Well, as you guessed it, this is a comment Node -->
        <p>This is also an Element Node</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
document
```

- Yes, everything has to be in the DOM including our comments

- 심지어 <!DOCTYPE html> 또한 Node다

# What are the different types of Nodes?

- There are only a handful of active (or relevant) Node types
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*qcHwWOp1n2jy3UntSKe-Sw.png)

The 4 most common ones we'll deal with are:

1. Document Node
2. Element Nodes
3. Text Nodes
4. Comment Nodes

# Node - Family Tree

We've seen the different types of nodes. But, how do we know what node type we're dealing with at any given time?

- Every node has a `nodeType`, `nodeName and nodeValue `

Before we see this in action, you need to understand `family dynamics`

```html
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <h2>World</h2>
    </div>
</body>
```

# Identifying nodes

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*N6I6-ni-RDPVCA1SvPZXYw.png)

`$0`는 무엇을 의미할까?

```javascript
$0
<-- well, as you ... -->
$0.nodeType; // 8
$0.nodeName;  // "#comment"
$0.nodeValue; // " Well, as you guessed it"'
```

# nodeName vs tagName

With `nodeName`, you can view the name of an element or tag you’re dealing with. You can just console log the `nodeName`.

Like this for example:

![Using nodeName to find the name of the html element](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2020-10-30_10-36-49-7e204e33d89d724b3f1e2e464a16ab6c.png?secure=zmO_ehbJAXEAobIHZbpLNg%3D%3D%2C1613812381)



Although there are only a distinct number of node **TYPES** (remember, we covered this in a previous lecture. There are text nodes, comment nodes, element nodes, etc), the node **NAMES** will tell you what element or tag node you’re dealing with. This means that for a `<p>` element, the `nodeName` property will return “P”. And for a `<div>` element, the returned `nodeName` properly will be “DIV” and so on.

The `nodeName` is a `read-only property of DOM nodes`. The returned value is always a CAPITAL string that represents the element type.

As a side note, the `nodeName` value gives you absolutely no other information (for example you can’t find out any attributes), so its limited in use I guess.



#### **Hold onto your horses, isn’t this the same thing as the** `**tagName**` **property?**



Kind of.

Another property you can access which will give you the same answer is `tagName`. And similarly to `nodeName` , `tagName` will return the result in CAPITAL letters.

So they look the same, as follows:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2020-10-30_10-43-12-a9b661b6ca9acf57d1c83ccde9104a83.PNG?secure=HbK58SyWHOg4G-80otfoeg%3D%3D%2C1613812381)



#### **So Clyde, does this mean** `**nodeName**` **and** `**tagName**` **are the same thing?** 



No. They are different.

The `tagName` property is `meant specifically for element nodes` (remember a few lectures ago, these are TYPE 1 nodes) to get the type of *element*. But as you already know, there are numerous other TYPES of nodes (such as comment nodes, text nodes, etc). To get the name of those nodes you can’t use `tagName`.

Here is proof that you can’t use `tagName` on a comment for example:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2020-10-30_10-45-23-65a5d97bd1054dda2e7e7ed673ad2713.png?secure=89-UsemeemwviLrc8YeN7A%3D%3D%2C1613812381)

So then, when dealing with Elements, which should you use – `nodeName` or `tagName`?

Good question my dear student 😉

It doesn’t really matter I guess. As we’ve just seen, when using `nodeName` against an *element node*, you'll get its tag name, so either could be used.

However, if a gun were pointed at my head and I had to choose one over the other, I would probably go with `nodeName` . This will likely give us better consistency across browsers.

Lets march on. I hope you found this useful.

# HTMLCollection vs NodeList

```javascript
document.getElementById(); // returns an element object
document.getElementsByClassName(); // returns an HTMLCollection
document.getElementsByTagName(); // returns an HTMLCollection
document.querySelector(); // returns an element object
document.querySelectorAll(); // returns a NodeList
```

Both a NodeList and an HTMLCollection are `collections` of DOM nodes.

A NodeList can contain any node type (text, comment, element, etc)

An HTMLCollection only contains an element node

#### What is the practical difference between them?

`HTMLCollection` can be accessed by their name, id or index number

`NodeList` items can only be accessed by their index number

`HTMLCollections` only contain element nodes

`HTMLCollections` are live, and `NodeList` items are typically `static` 

# Live vs Static Lists

List를 만들었다고 생각해보자, 나중에 DOM을 변경했을때, Original List는 갱신될 수 있다.

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>B</li>
            <li>C</li>
        </ul>
        <script>
        	// lets access our list items
            let listItems_tags = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
            console.log(listItems_tags);
            console.log(listItems_tags.length);
            
            // Let's modify the DOM and add a list item
            listItems_tags[0].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement('li'));
            console.log(listItems_tags);
            console.log(listItems_tags.length);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>


// result 
// 1. 생성한 HTML의 모든 li태그에 접근했다 (getElementsByTagName)을 이용해서.
// 2. getElementsByTagName을 사용하게 다면 다음번에 요소를 동적으로 변경할 수 있다. 이러한 이유 때문에 HTMLCollection이 Dynamic or Live로 간주되는 것이다.

HTMLCollection(3)
3

HTMLCollection(4)
4
```

- `HTMLCollection`  방식 처럼 Dynamic 하게 요소가 늘어나는게 당연하다. 하지만 만약 요소가 늘어나는 것을 제한하고 싶은 경우에는 어떻게 해야할까?

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>B</li>
            <li>C</li>
        </ul>
        <script>
            // Node List Time
			let listItems = document.querySelectorAll('li');
            // We can see it returns a Node List
            console.log(listItems);
            console.log(listItems.length);
            
            // let's add to the list and prove that the NodeList is static
            listItems[0].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement('li'));
            console.log(listItems);
            console.log(listItems.length);
            
            // lets re-quert the DOM
            listItems = document.querySelectorAll('li');
            console.log(listItems);
            console.log(listItems.length);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

// result
NodeList(3) [li, li, li]
3
NodeList(3) [li, li, li ] // becasue it only references to the original
3
// DOM에는 li가 하나 더 추가된 것을 확인할 수 있다.

// Re-Query를 해줘야 업데이트 된다 (Performance Heavy하다)
NodeList(4) [li, li, li, li]
4
```

Why can't we use the parentNode method on an HTMLCollection directly?

You would have noticed in the previous lecture that our code looked like this: 

```
listItems_tags**[0]**.parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement('li'));
```

Lets understand why we have to access a node by using the [0] notation, rather than leaving this out.

#### Lets look at an example

Lets create a list:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-25_10-00-26-ae4bf583c9d5955b4ce229dd56a493e9.png?secure=QftSGU4EawuOXnCntpWWtA%3D%3D%2C1613813733)

Now lets put this entire list into an `HTMLCollection`, like this:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-25_10-02-38-fa6a33895770cc970bbfa8735a643b83.png?secure=8S3nx72_k_wlzINjoTYRUQ%3D%3D%2C1613813733)

If we want to get to the <ul> tag, we can use `parentNode`.

We **can’t** do this:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-25_10-02-18-7d56994c781eabdfc4a4a5f1327633b2.png?secure=FbIpog_oGVgyQLuCJ7zuXg%3D%3D%2C1613813733)

But **we can** do this:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-25_10-02-06-c665ca65c3c2219f72e6d9706e4d9e9d.png?secure=abua8CVRGcUK2EX4L9G2DA%3D%3D%2C1613813733)

**The question is,** why do we have to access an actual <li> element (in our case the first li element using [0] notation)?

#### parentNode only works on nodes

Remember, the `parentNode` property is read only property which returns us the name of the parent node of the node its implemented on.

If we console our `listItems`, we get the following:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-04-25_10-04-33-a18461a07b8ede44a6cf3f8d678e21bf.png?secure=Q0kzWw8uWujng8Y3T4jYXA%3D%3D%2C1613813733)

It’s an `HTMLCollection`, which is a collection of DOM nodes (as a reminder, while a `NodeList` can contain any node type, an `HTMLCollection` is supposed to only contain Element nodes).

Bottom line: an `HTMLCollection` is a COLLECTION of nodes. Its not a node itself.

And this is why you can’t use the `parentNode` method on the `HTMLCollection` itself … we have to access one of the elements inside it. We just so happened to use the first item in the collection using [0] notation, but we could have just as easily used [1] or [2] to get the same result.

Hope this helps.

요약: `parentNode`를 바로 `HTMLCollection`에 사용하지 못하는 이유는 `HTMLCollection`은 `A Node`가 아니라 a `Collection of Nodes` 이기 때문에
