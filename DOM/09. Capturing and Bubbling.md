# Capturing and Bubbling

## An event is not an isolated occurrence

**Event Bubbling**

We've seen `addEventListener()`.

But we haven't discussed an advanced topic of how events get fired.

An event is not an isolated disturbance. (Butterfly Effect)

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="one">
            <div id="two">
                <div id="three-a">
                    <button id="button1">
                        Button One
                    </button>
                </div>
                <div id="three-b">
                    <button id="button2">
                        Button Two
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

## How to listen to an event during the capturing phase

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*qlbe3ympjv-yl8e3lqIIdQ.png)

**default** 값은 **false**

## Example - Let's listen to an event during both phases

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <button id="button1">Button one</button>
        <button id="button2">Button Two</button>
        <script>
            let buttonOne = document.getElementById('button1');
            // Let's execute our handler in the capturing phase
            buttonOne.addEventListener('click', clickHandler, true);
            // Let's execute our handler in the bubbling phase (default)
            buttonOne.addEventListener('click', clickHandler, false);

            // Define our handler
            function clickHandler() {
                console.log('I have been clicked!');
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

`button1`을 클릭하면, `html` -->`body` --> `button`까지 내려가고

`I have been clicked`가 두 번 클릭되는 것을 확인할 수 있다.

`button2`를 클릭하면, `window`가 이벤트를 확인하고 `(listen & execute)`

`I have been clicked`가 한 번 클릭되는 것을 확인할 수 있다.

## Who cares about capturing vs bubbling?

**EVENT BUBBLING - THE FLOW OF EACH EVENT THROUGH THE DOM**

Who cares?

Mostly it doesn't matter

But sometimes you'll need to distinguish between capturing vs bubbling

- Nested menus
- Third party library
- Overrides

## How to stop event capturing and event bubbling?

**THE FLOW OF EACH EVENT THROUGH THE DOM**

Let's talk about **propagating**

Sometimes we want to kill our event - stop if from reaching the root.

**stopPropagation** prevents our event from running through our DOM.

## Example of stopPropagation

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="three-a">
            <button id="button1">Button One</button>
        </div>
        <script>
            let buttonOne = document.getElementById('button1');
            // Let's execute our handler in the capturing phase
            // This fires duing the capturing phase
            buttonOne.addEventListener('click', clickHandler, true);
            // Let's execute our handler in the bubbling phase (default)
            // This fires during the bubbling phase
            buttonOne.addEventListener('click', clickHandler, false);
            // Add listener on our DIV Parent Element
            let threeA = document.getElementById('three-a');
            threeA.addEventListener('click', quitIt, true);

            function quitIt(e) {
                console.log('You have been stopped in your tracks');
                // Remember, the addEventListener() method gives us access to the 'event' object in the callback automatically
                // To access this object, we have to put in a variable - which we've called 'e'
                e.stopPropagation();
            }

            function clickHandler() {
                console.log('I have been clicked');
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

`e.stopPropagation()`을 주석 처리했을 때

![image-20210321212755640](C:\Users\jos50\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210321212755640.png)

The `stopPropagation()` method stops the move of the event upwards or downwards. 

It will still execute all handlers on the current element.

If you want to stop the execution of handlers on the current element, we can use:

`event.stopImmediatePropagation()`

## Quiz

1. What does the process of `event propagation` mean?

- `Propagation` literally means `transmission of motion, light, sound, etc` in a particular direction.
- In the context of the DOM, `event propagation` basically governs the flow of an event through the DOM.

- `Event bubbling` and `Event capturing` are two ways of `event propagation` in the DOM API. The `event propagation`  process determines in which order various HTML elements receive the event that has just been fired.



2. Why is it important for us to learn about `event propagation` (i.e. event bubbling and capturing)?

- Because events are not an isolated occurrence. When an event is fired in the browser, it can cause multiple knock-on effects. You have obvious effects (like saving a users details when he/she clicks on a 'submit' button), but `event propagation` digs deeper. It looks at what effects the event has within the DOM (e.g. a click event could occur on a `<p>` element, that triggers other event handlers within your DOM). `Event propagation` helps us to write better code and also helps us to understand how to create awesome websites that are intuitive and easy for our users to use.

 

3. Where do all events originate from?

- Events always originate at the root of your document, being the `window` object.



4. What happens with event propagation each time an event is fired?

- The event propagation model combines `capturing` and `bubbling` by saying that an event first makes its way downwards from window object to the element that fired the event, visiting the `capturers` along the way, and then bubbles back up visiting the non-capturing handlers.
- Every event that is fired `"trickles down, and bubbles up"`



5. What is `event capturing`?

- With `capturing`, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated (i.e. transported) to the inner elements.



6. What is `event bubbling`?

- With `bubbling`, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements, until it reaches the root of your document.

- When an event is fired on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors until the event reaches the root of your document. And to throw some more knowledge at you, back in the old days, Netscape advocated event capturing, while Microsoft promoted event bubbling. Both of these phases are part of the W3C DOM Events standard today.



7. Do `all` events in the DOM bubble?

- No

- Not all events will bubble up through the DOM. For instance, a focus event does not bubble. There are other events that also don't bubble, for example, events fired on the window object (like the load and resize event) or other non-DOM objects like XHRs.



8. If all events originate on the `window object`, how do you know which element triggered the event?

- A handler can always get the details about where an event was fired from. The most deeply nested element that caused the event to happen is called the `target` element, accessible as `event.target`



9. Using the `addEventListener()` method, you can choose whether each event handler participates in the capturing phase or the bubbling phase. How do you do this?

- You include the word `true` in the third argument of the function if you want the handler functions to execute during the capturing phase like this: `addEventListener(event, handler, true);`
- Remember, there are three arguments to the `addEventListener() function.` We are dealing with the third argument. In this third argument, there are only 2 possible values of the capture option: If it's `false` (default), then the handler is set on the `bubbling phase`. If it's `true`, then the handler is set on the `capturing phase`.



10. Assume a `click` event happens on the `<li>` element. If you have registered to execute your event handlers in the `capturing phase`, what will the order of handler execution be?

```html
<div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

- The event will be handled by the `div` first. In other words, all `click` event handlers in the `div` element will fire first. Then all `click` event handlers in the `ul` will fire, then the last `click` event in the target element, `li` will fire.



11. Assume a `click` event happens on the `<li>` element. If you have registered to execute your event handlers in the `bubbling phase` what will the order of handler execution be?

- The event will be handled by the `li` first. In other words, all `click` event handlers in the `li` element will fire first. Then all `click` event handlers in the `ul` will fire, then the last `click` event in the ultimate parent element, `div` will fire.
