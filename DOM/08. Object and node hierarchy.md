**Advanced Topic**

I was surprised to find out how little the topic of `DOM Objects vs JavaScript Objects` is covered on the web. 

And often, you'll see coders adding their own custom methods and properties to these DOM objects - a practice known as **"Extending the DOM"**. However, what's disturbing is that **"downsides of this seemingly useful practice"** doesn't seem to be well known.

The lack of information could well explain why there are libraries **"out there today (like Prototype JavaScript Library)"** that fall into the trap of implementing DOM extensions.

But before I jump ahead of myself, I'd like to explain what DOM objects are, and how the node hierarchy works. This will give you a better understanding of why DOM extensions are generally not a great idea.

Another huge benefit of learning about the node hierarchy is understanding where the properties you use are coming from. Oftentimes, you'll find yourself in a hole ... Knowing how to dig yourself out of this hole is what separates the pros of from the rookies.

## NATIVE vs HOST OBJECTS

What's the difference?

Don't get confused between JavaScript objects and DOM objects.

Every **node** in **the DOM** inherits methods / properties from its parent **node**.

Every **object** in **JavaScript** inherits methods / properteis from its parent **object**.

Pretty much everything in **JavaScript** in an **object**.

Pretty much everything in the **DOM** in a **node**.

Every **object / node** contains a private property which holds a link to its prototype.

In a nutshell, 

In the DOM, A node is generic term for any type of object.

In JavaScript, an object is a complex **data-type**

We can say then, that there are **2 object types**

**Native VS Host**

**Native:** 

These are core predefined objects always available in **JavaScript**.

These objects are set out in the **ECMAScript specification (the 'spec')**.

Examples of native objects include `Object`, `Function`, `String`, `Math`, `Boolean`, `etc`.

```javascript
let dog = "woof";
typeof(dog); // string
```

**Host:**

Provided by a specific environment in order to server a specific purpose.

There objects are not defined by **ECMAScript**.

Not all environments have **the same host objects.**

Examples of host objects include `window`, `history`, `document`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `etc`

```javascript
// This may feel like a normal JavaScript object, but its not. The object referenced by our 'p' variable is a NodeList, which is not defined anywhere in the ECMAScript spec.
let p = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
```

**WINDOW**(root object - given to us by the browser)

- DOM - **document, Event, console, Node, etc**
- BOM - **screen, history, frames, navigator, etc** 
- JavaScript - **Object, Number, Date, String, etc**

**DOM vs BOM**

Our browser gives us **DOM** and **BOM objects** automatically.

That's why we call these objects **"host"** objects

**The** **DOM** is governed by the **W3C** consortium. This organization defines how browsers should construct **the DOM**.

**The BOM** is not governed - its free!

**The BOM** is all about the view and other stuff - **not the 'content' of the page**

## The importance of understanding inheritance

NODE HIERARCHY

HOW NODES GET ALL THEIR METHODS AND PROPERTIES

We know that **the DOM** has a whole bunch of **objects / nodes** given to us.

**These node objects** are different to **JavaScript objects**.

The full set of properties and methods of a node comes as the result of **inheritance**.

## Element node - object hierarchy

How do we know if it is the DOM object?

## Conclusion

NODE HIERARCHY

The full set of properties and methods of a given node comes from **inheritance**.

We looked at a <p> element, which gets properteis and methods from:

**HTMLParagraphElement** - provides paragraph-specific properteis

**HTMLElement** - provides common **HTML** element methods such as **getters** and **setters**

**Element** - provides general element methods (like **the Selector** API)

**Node** - provides general DOM node properties

**EventTarget** - gives support for events (like **the addEventListener()** method) 

## What is DOM extension?

The process of adding custom methods / properteis to DOM objects.

Remember, DOM objects are **host objects** that inherit from the Element, Event, Document or other DOM interfaces.

The most popular extended objects are DOM elements like <p> or <div> tags (i.e. elements that inherit from the Element interface)

- Prototype
- Mootools

## Adding our own DOM extension - practical example

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*OrGzlSf30rDAp6ab6Pv1rg.png)

## Are DOM extensions a good thing?

```javascript
Element.prototype.red = function() {
    this.style.color = 'red';
}
/*
Æ’ () {
    this.style.color = 'red';
}
*/
let p = document.createElement('p');
// undefined
document.write('hi');
// undefined
p.textContent = "This is a new paragraph element";
// "This is a new paragraph element"
document.body.appendChild(p);
// <p>This is a new paragraph element</p>
p.red();
// undefined
```

- We first assign the red function to the Element prototype.
- We then create our paragraph element, and we can invoke the red function directly on it.

We have to be careful about where we attach this `red` function onto.

If we create a property on the prototype of the `HTMLParagraphElement` for example, we won't be able to use it on the anchor element.

```javascript
HTMLParagraphElement.prototype.red = function() {
    this.style.color = 'red';
}

let a = document.createElement('p');
a.red();
```

## The problems with DOM extensions are ...

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*vDTXlUwB8_OEtN4rNtr_mw.png)

**Right Prototype**

If you attach a property to the prototype of a DOM element, it can only be accessed by an object that has that same prototype as part of its chain.

- **Element** ('red' property)
- **Comment node** (won't have access to the 'red' property)
- Text node (won't have access to the 'red' property)

**No Rules**

Remember, **DOM objects** are **host objects**.

```javascript
let p = document.createElement('p');
// Can't we just add our own method to this newely created p element?
p.red = function() {
    this.style.color = 'red';
}
```

This is not the best idea. Every time you want to use the `red` property, you'll first need to extend the object.

Another problem is when it comes to events. Some events can fire dozens of times per second, so extending each `p` element you create is a very slow and inefficient process.

And host objects are the most difficult to work with.

Extending DOM objects is kind of like walking in a minefield.

**Collisions**

Is the property you're trying to add already part of the DOM?

can you overwrite it?

Does it have knock-on effects?

Remember, **HTML5** brings new methods and properteis all the time.

**Summary**

Generally, DOM extensions are not a great idea.

This is true even if you only want your site to work on 2 browsers.

One solution is to use `object wrappers` (this is what **jQuery** has done)

- For example, we can use `Object.create()` and refer to a custom prototype we've created.
