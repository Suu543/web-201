# Different Types of Events

Events are not only used with JavaScript.

Although this course puts a lot of focus on using web events with JavaScript, they are not unique to the web browser only.

What do I mean?

Well, most programming languages have some kinds of event model, and they all work in slightly different ways (i.e. in a way that differs from the way JavaScript works in a browser).

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-09_17-40-22-d043bee319f1c7b7803d831e46ca9924.png?secure=Kphv5v_rblP5y0V-k-P8Gg%3D%3D%2C1616146127)

For example, `Node.js` is a very popular JavaScript runtime that enables developers to write JavaScript in the `backend`. In other words, `Node.js` allows you to write server-side applications with JavaScript. Important to us, that the `Node.js` event model relies on listeners to listen for events and emitters to emit events periodically.

As you can already tell, its kinda similar. However, the code can be quite different. `Node.js` makes use of functions like `on()` to register an event listener whereas in this course we're using methods like `addEventListener()`

**WEB EXTENSIONS**

Another example of using JavaScript with events is with a technology called `WebExtensions`. Again, its kinda similar, but also different. The event model here uses `camel-case` to attach a listener (e.g. we write `onMessage` rather than `onmessage`). You also need to use an `addListener()` function.

**What's my point?**

My point is that although we're focusing on a particular aspect of event listeners (i.e. web events), what you learn in this course can be applied to other technology stacks. 

Although the way events work is slightly different across different technologies, the concepts you learn here will help you learn and master other environments faster.

## Quick click event example - before

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <label>Name Please <input type="text" id="name"></label>
        <br />
        <label>What is your favorite animal?
            <select id="animal">
                <option value="dog">Dog</option>
                <option value="cat">Cat</option>
                <option value="horse">Horse</option>
            </select>
        </label>
        <br />
        <button id="button">Submit</button>
        <div id="message"></div>
    <!-- Now Let's access the DOM via JavaScript -->
        <script>
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Quick click event example - after

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <label>Name Please <input type="text" id="name"></label>
        <br />
        <label>What is your favorite animal?
            <select id="animal">
                <option value="dog">Dog</option>
                <option value="cat">Cat</option>
                <option value="horse">Horse</option>
            </select>
        </label>
        <br />
        <button id="button">Submit</button>
        <div id="message"></div>
    <!-- Now Let's access the DOM via JavaScript -->
        <script>
            // step 1: Grab the button
            let button = document.getElementById('button');
            // step 2: Add the event listener
            button.addEventListener('click', onButtonClick);
            // step 3: Define our handler function
            function onButtonClick() {
                let messageDiv = document.getElementById('message');
                let name = document.getElementById('name').value;
                let animal = document.getElementById('animal').value;
                // console.log(name.value);
                // Let's output our message
                messageDiv.textContent = `Hi ${name}, I would love to have your ${animal}, please!`;
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Quick word on `<forms>`

What if we wrapped everything in a `<form>` element?

In the previous example we did not wrap the `<select>`, `<button>` and `<div>` elements inside a `<form>`. Why?

 `Forms` are a beast of their own. What I mean by this is that they are subject to certain rules.

**What kind of rules?**

For example, when you click on a submit button (or an input element with `type="submit"`), then the browser will automatically validate all of the `<input>` elements in the form and submit it to the action URL if there aren't any validation problems. The result of this when you have not specified an action URL is that the page will refresh.

Therefore, in our previous example, if we were to wrap all of our elements inside a `<form>` tag, then eventually when the form is submitted, the entire browser will refresh. You will only see the message appear in the `<div>` tag momentarily, before everything resets itself.

**Bottom Line:**

When a submit event is fired within a form, the browser will automatically send that form data to a server, and the browser will refresh the page.

**How do we stop this unwanted behavior?**

The only way to avoid this behavior is to make the form submit via JavaScript or AJAX.

Let me show you a quick example of using JavaScript, and the `preventDefault()` method. In case you are wondering, the `preventDefault()` method is given to us by the browser (specifically, it is a Web API given to us by the DOM). As the name suggests, using this method tells the browser that the default action (in our case the page refresh), should not happen.

Just remember, when we listen for an event, we get the event object passed to us automatically. In the below code we've put this object into a variable we've named `e`. This is where we get our `preventDefault()` method from.

## Event Types

Common Events - Events that you will encounter the most

DOM events are "things" that have happened.

Each event is unique and is an object with its own properties and methods.

All events inherit from the `Event` object.

- `resource`, `focus`, `form`, `window`, `printing`, `touch`, `tab`, `CSS animation`, `mouse`, `network`, `keyboard`, `svg`, `view`, `session history`

## Where are events from?

`Web APIs`

As mentioned, there are lots of Web APIs available straight out of the box. I mentioned a few of them, including the Fetch API, Websockets API, etc.

**Where are `Events` from?**

Remember in Part 1 of this series, we learnt that the DOM represents a document as a tree. This means that each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. But importantly for us, nodes can also have `event listeners and handlers` attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event handler get executed.

The DOM has many interfaces `(Such as the Document, Window, NodeList, etc)`. But the one of interest to us is the Event Interface.

So the short answer is that Events are from the DOM.

**What is the Event Interface?**

So, we know that `Events` are given to us by the DOM. But let's keep going down the rabbit hole ... where exactly in the DOM can they be found? This is where the `Event` interface comes into the picture.

The Event interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM. There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces base on the main `Event` interface. For example, the keypress event inherits from the Event interface, but is also has a whole bunch of its own properties and methods found in the `KeyboardEvent` interface.

## Keydown event - example

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
        	document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
                console.log(event.key);
                console.log('event', event);
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Quiz

1. **Are events only applicable for web browsers and JavaScript? Yes**

- Nice job! Although this course puts a lot of focus on using web events with JavaScript, they are not unique to the web browser only. Most programming languages use event models (including Node.js). What you're learning in this course can be applied to other languages, so keep going and stay motivated.

2. **Which of the below statement is `true`?**

- There are many different types of events, including form events, mouse events, touch events, keyboard events and so on ... there are tons!
- This is why events are so important to master. Because there are so many different types, we will only work with a handful in this course. But the good news is that once you understand how they work, the picking up different event types (that we haven't covered in this course) will become second nature to you and should you very quick to master.

3. **There are many different types of events in the web browser. But where do all of these events come from? In other words, who gives us access to all of these events?**

- The browser gives us access to many different types of events.

4. **What is the Event Interface?**

- It forms the basis of every event that is fired in the DOM. It provides properties and meaningful values for all event types. Although each event has its own specific type of interface (e.g. the 'click' event inherits from the `MouseEvent interface`), all interfaces are actually related to one another and form a hierarchy. The Event Interface is the root or top of the hierarchy.
- The Event interface defines very useful properties, such as the type of event that occurred, the target, the timeStamp and a boolean value specifying whether the current event bubbles up the DOM tree.

5. **What is the MouseEvent interface?**

- The `MouseEvent interface` inherits the properteis and methods of the `Event interface`, and contains useful properties and methods like `button`, `clientX`, `clientY`, and `shiftKey`. Many user actions, such as the click event, `mousemove event`, `mouseup`, and `mousedown events`, inherit from the `MouseEvent interface`.
- The `MouseEvent Interface` immediately inherits from the `UIEvent`, which in turn inherits from the `Event interface`.

**Dynamic dot movement and complete solution**

```html
<!-- Somehow, we need to make the top and left values dynamic (i.e. they need to constantly change to the location of our mouse point) -->
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            .dot {
                background: black;
                width: 0.5em;
                height: 0.5em;
                border-radius: 2px;
                position: absolute;
                top: 50px;

            // step 1: Grab our image element
            let background = document.getElementById('bg');
            // step 2: Defining our handler function
            let onMouseMove = (e) => {
                // a. grab our div element that we want to insert text into
                let message = document.getElementById('message');
                // b. define our main handler functionality
                message.textContent += `Hi `;

                document.body.appendChild(dotDiv);
                // let's access our event object and dynamically update the top and left style properties
                
                // MouseEvent is an interface that applies to events that occur due to mouse interactions. Common events using this interface include the well-known click event, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown, and of course, the mousemove event

                // clientX, clientY
                // console.log(e);
                // Remember, clientY gives us the vertical distance (in pixels) from the top left of the content area (the viewport). It starts at 0px 0px in the upper left cornet is as wide/tall as your browser window is open(minus scroll bars, frame, title bar, etc)

                // We've managed to dynamically change the top position property of our dot. We did so by accessing the clientY property of the MouseEvent.

                // clientX --> horizontal position
                dotDiv.style.top = `${e.clientY}px`;
                dotDiv.style.left = `${e.clientX - 3}px`;
            }
            // step 3: Attach our event listener
            background.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove); 
        </script>
    </body>

```

**Mustache Project**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            #mustache {
                position: absolute;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img id="person" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Wvpg76LaZc6SUAz6lcPmXA.jpeg" width=300px alt="person image">
        <img id="mustache" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*eAtdQpks3dgWOIt7M-2psQ.png" alt="mustache image">
        <script>
            // step 1: Grab the person image
            let personPic = document.getElementById('person');
            // step 2: Define our handler function
            let onPersonClick = (e) => {
                // let's grab our mustache picture
                let mustachePic = document.getElementById('mustache');
                // grab our event object and use that to figure our the users mouse position
                let top = e.clientY;
                let left = e.clientX;
                // make the position of the mustache the same as the mouse position
                mustachePic.style.top =`${top - 54}px`;
                mustachePic.style.left =`${left - 100}px`;
            };
            // step 3: Attach a click event to the person image
            personPic.addEventListener('click', onPersonClick);

        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

You see, I told you these challenges would be fun.

Seriously, well done for getting through them. By now, you're probably getting quite familiar with how to work with events, how to listen for them, and how to access the event object to get additional properties and methods (like `clientX` and `clientY`).

But we're only just getting started.

In the next sections we're going to learn a ton more, including node hierarchy, bubbling, event delegation and more.
