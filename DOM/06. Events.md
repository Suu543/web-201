# Events

An event is an action a user (or browser) has taken

- Hovers over an element
- Presses a key
- Clicks a button
- Submits a form
- Page finishes loading

Events take place in the browser

How do we use events?

- JavaScript

`Important`:

Web events are not part of the core JavaScript language - they are given to us by the DOM API built into the browser.

### This is how I like to think about events

We know that the DOM API provides us with events.

In other words, the actual itself has nothing to do with JavaScript. So then, where exactly does JavaScript fit in?

As soon as the event fires, we need to do something right? Yep, and that's where JavaScript comes to the rescue. After JavaScript executes, then the DOM API can continue to do its business and update the page if required. 

The point to remember is that events and JavaScript are different, but very closely related.

## The 2 most important things when it comes to events

`Events` - actions taken by the user or browser

Mostly, you'll want to run code when the user does something. 

There are many different types of events.

- When a user clicks a button, a `click event` is fired
- When a user presses a key, a `keypress event` is fired
- When your browser fetches & loads all data, a `load event` is fired

You need to understand 2 things in order to master `events`

- `listener`
  - inline event listeners
  - inline properties
  - event listeners
    - `'listens'` out for the event
- `handler`
  - Each event (click, keypress, etc) needs an event handler. 
  - An event handler is a block of code that runs when the event happens `(fires)`.
    - code that runs when an event has fired.



### Event Listener and Event Handler

You can think of Events as a generalization of all the things the computer can react to. By react I just mean, to do something after the event has happened.

For example, when you press a key, a `keydown` event is fired. You can react to this event if you want to. But there are other events. A click, a window resize, a scroll are all actions that the computer can react to.

### Listener

The DOM API gives us a way to listen to events happening in the DOM. For example, you can start and stop listening to events by attaching an event listener to certain elements.

### Handler

If you want to react to a certain event and do something when a specific action takes place, we need to write a JavaScript function that deals with the event. This function is called the `handler` of the event.

### Summary

We can look really smart by saying that, technically, we are using event handlers to listen to events. But I like to think of the below scenario as doing a pretty good job as showing the difference between events, listeners and handlers.

Take the scenario:

1. You hover over a button, and click your mouse = `Event`
2. The button element that is listening/waiting for you to click your mouse = `Event Listener`
3. What you do after the mouse has been clicked = `Event Handler`

## Inline Event Listeners

`listener`

The different ways we can add a listener to an element

1. inline event listeners
2. inline properties
3. event listeners

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <button onclick=boom()>
            Click Me!
        </button>
        
   	<script>
    	function boom() {
            alert("BOOM!");
        }    
	</script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Do we need to wrap out attribute values in quotation marks?

#### Concluding comments

Let me finish off by saying 3 things:

1. As per the HTML spec, we don’t always need to wrap our attribute values in quotation marks
2. This is why we could write our `boom()` function without quotation marks. Remember, like this `<button onclick=boom()>`
3. **If in doubt, always wrap your attribute values in quotes (its just good practice)**

## Why is it important to learn about inline event listeners

#### Inline event listeners are old-school

Inline event handling … it's very mention brings shivers up developers' backs! Most developers will say you should never use inline event handlers.

As a web developer. you may be wondering why you need to learn about old-school approaches such as the inline event listener.

Well, my philosophy is that you need to understand the old, in order to understand the new. Yes, there are limitations to this of course - none of us want to learn web development techniques that are out-dated and redundant. But, you will commonly see inline event listeners in your career, so this becomes really important for you to understand. It also sets the base for the new `addEventListener()` method which we will be getting into shortly.

#### Should you **never** use inline event handlers

Remember what Charles Dickens said:

> Never say never.

In other words, whenever there are thousands of good reasons not to do something, there are times when doing that very thing is exactly what's needed.

Now, I'm not here to tell you to start using inline event handlers in your apps, but I will venture to say that is that there is a real possibility that you'll have to deal with them at some point. When that time comes, you should be aware of inline event handlers' numerous caveats.

            alert("BOOM");
        }

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <button>
            Click Me!
        </button>
        
   	<script>
        // step 1: find the element we want to add an event listener to
        let btn = document.querySelector('button');
        // step 2: add the addEventListener to our button
        btn.addEventListener('click', boom);
        // step 3: ltes define our boom function
        
    	function boom() {
            alert("BOOM!");
        }    
	</script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## 3 ways to add an event listener

Although the `addEventListener()` method is the most preferred way to add an event listener to window, document or any other element in the DOM, we've seen that is it not the only way. 

Here's a quick visual recap on what we've learnt so far.

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-04_09-48-34-91250b455c770dda499cab5d39e7bbc9.jpg?secure=Lt6N31ArPHTB-_rWHbOx_A%3D%3D%2C1615995868)

## Are event listeners heavy on performance?

**Event listeners are great, but how do they work?**

You may think that the event listener that we've attached to the element constantly checks if the event has been fired. This kinda make sense.

But if this were the case, you would agree with me that this would then mean that having more event listeners on our page would slow it down. There would be hundreds of checks and pings going on in the background, all the time.

**Fortunately, listeners are lazy, just like my Aunt Betty**

The term "event listener" is throwing you off. By using a verb, it suggests that the `listeners` is actively doing something to listen. 

This is not the case.

In fact, it's not doing anything at all. It's just sitting there, waiting.

This `listener` is a function that is subscribed to the event, meaning that when the event is actually fired, it will be notified. This `listener` will then call the event handler to execute.

The benefit of this pattern is that there's no cost until the button (or whatever the event is) is actually pushed (or fired). The event can be handled this way without being monitored because it originates from what developers call a `hardware interrupt`, which briefly preempts the running code to fire the event.

## Recap

This is the easiest way - `Inline Event Listener`

We are writing our click listener (and in this case handler) within our HTML.

But its not great, since it is inefficient, unmanageable, not search engine friendly. Its like writing inline CSS on an HTML element - its just not good.

```html
<button onclick="alert('hi')">
    Click Me
</button>
```

## Test - Inline Event Listeners

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            h1, p {
                text-align: center;
            }

            button {
                display: block;
                margin: 2em 0;
                margin-left: auto;
                margin-right: auto;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 id="title">This is a really fun website</h1>
        <p id="first-paragraph">Wally The Warthog is a greate pet</p>
        <p id="second-paragraph">Wally eats a lot of grass</p>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <button onclick="blue()">How about making everything blue?</button>
            <button  onclick="red()">How about making everything red?</button>    
        </div>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
let title = document.querySelector("#title");
let para1 = document.querySelector('#first-paragraph');
let para2 = document.querySelector('#second-paragraph');

function blue () {
    let color = 'blue';
    title.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
    para1.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
    para2.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
}

function red () {
    let color = 'red';
    title.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
    para1.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
    para2.setAttribute('style', 'color: ' + color);
}
```

### Better Approach

```javascript
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
let paras = document.querySelectorAll("p");
 
function blue() {
  h1.style.color = "blue";
  paras.forEach((para) => (para.style.color = "blue"));
}
 
function red() {
  h1.style.color = "red";
  paras.forEach((para) => (para.style.color = "red"));
}
 
```

## Recap - Inline Properties

This is very similar to the inline event listener. 

Except here, we're setting the property of an element by using JavaScript instead of the attribute in HTML

```html
<button>
	Click Me!
</button>
```

Our function will remain similar as well, but now we need to access the button element in JavaScript

```javascript
let btn = document.querySelector('button');
```

Remember, under both approaches we are eventually attaching an event listener as a property on our HTML element.

This is slightly better than directly writing our event listener in our HTML file directly.

But its still not the best approach and suffers from some hurdles (e.g. setting multiple separate event properties is cumbersome).

## Event handling the better way

Although the previous 2 methods of listening and handling events are common and go back in time, there's a more modern approach.

The `addEventListener()` method is more flexible and is the recommended way to listen for events with the DOM. What's really useful with this method is that when the event fires (for example, the 'click' event), it automatically gives us access to a very useful method - the event object itself with all of its properties and methods. By convention, programmers usually name this object `e`, but we can call it anything we want (as we'll see in the upcoming lectures).

## addEventListener() method

This is a modern approach.

We do not assign an event directly on a property of the HTML element.

Instead, we use the `addEventListener()` method.

This event listener will listen or watch for an event being fired on the HTML element that we attach it to



Question: is `addEventListener()` JavaScript?

Answer: No

When writing code, there are a whole bunch of web APIs that we can use right our of the box.

- Fetch()
- History API
- Storage
- File System API
- Websockets API

Web APIs are mostly used with JavaScript, but you don't strictly have to always use JavaScript

How does it work?

`addEventListener(event, callback)`

The event is the action we're watching out for (e.g. onclick)

The callback is our event handler

The target (i.e. the element that fired the event) will automatically be given to us in the callback function.

`element.addEventListener(event, callback)`

This element is the `target`.

## CALLBACK

A function to be called after something else has happened. 

The `first argument` to the `addEventListener` is the event.

The `second argument` is the `event handler`, which is a `callback` function.

This `callback function` is automatically executed when the event fires.

Data about the event is given to us automatically through this `callback`

- `target`
- `type of event`
- `where the event occurred`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <body>
        <h1>Callbacks are awesome</h1>
        <script>
            let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
            // The event data will be given to us automatically. How do we access it? Easy!
            // We put the event data in a variable name of our choice - here we called our variable 'data'
            h1.addEventListener('click', (data) => {
                console.log(data);
            });
        </script>        
    </body>
</html>
```

## CALLBACK Function - Don't get intimidated

The formal definition from `MDN` is a little confusing.

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

**Heh?**

A callback function is just a function which is:

- Accessible by another function
- Invoked after the first function completes

There are a few other nuances of a callback function. For example, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. Remember our `addEventListener()` method. We passed our callback function (i.e. our event handler) inside of this function. And remember, a callback function is executed inside of the function it was passed into.

**Why do we need callbacks?**

For many reasons. At the most basic level, we use `callback` to run code in response to something happening. Pretty useful right?

Another example of why we would want to use `callback` is to stop a process from blocking our other code. 

Let me explain with the example.

`Client-Side JavaScript` runs in the browser. We know this. 

But this JavaScript process is `a single threaded event loop`.

This means that if we try to execute long-running operations within `a single-threaded event loop`, these processes will be blocked. This is bad because this will stop other JavaScript code executing and we'll have to wait for the operation to complete.

Want an example?

Look at the `alert` function. The `alert` function is considered as one of the blocking codes in JavaScript in the browser. If you `alert()`, you can no longer interact within the browser, until you close the alert dialog window.

**Conclusion**

A nice way of imagining how a callback function works is that it is a function that is `called after` the first function (that it was passed into) executes.

So, maybe a better name would have been to call it a `callafter` function

    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## What just Happened?

We had to produce a random color each time the circle was clicked.

```javascript
function changeColor() {
    let randomColor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777216).toString(16);
    circle.style.backgroundColor = `#${randomColor}`;
}
```

In order to do so, we had to generate a random number from 0 to 16,777,215

But Why?

**How do we set colors?**

1. **Keyword**

- Case insensitive identifiers that represent a specific color. Examples are using the keywords, such as red, blue, tomato, etc
- FYI: there are about 140 color names, give or take
2. **HSL System**

- Defines a color according to its hue, saturation and lightness
- An extra plan component represents the color's transparency

3. **RGB System**

- This is the one we used
- The RGB model defines a color according to its red, green and blue components
- RGB colors can be defined through both hexadecimal (#) and functional notations

```css
background-color: rgb(red, green, blue);
background-color: rgb(255, 99, 61);
background-color: hsl(9, 100%, 64%);
background-color: tomato;
background-color: #ff6347;
```

## Digits, Bytes, and Hexadecimal Format

**RGB Systems: Hexadecimal**

Hexadecimal numbers are "natural" to computers

**Binary Digit**

A binary digit can only be 0 or 1

2 is a magic number to most computer geeks out there

So, a bit represents values from 0 to 1 (i.e. 2 values)

Put 2 bits together, and you can represent 0, 1, 2 or 3 (i.e. 4 values)

Formula is simple - X bits can represent 2^X values



**bit** becomes a **byte**

The early computer engineers came up with `byte` as the next unit above a bit

A byte is defined as 8-bits

This means it can represent 2^8 numbers, or 256 different values

The minimum value of a byte is 0

The maximum value of a byte is 255(or 11111111 in binary form);

Hexadecimal numbers are "natural" to computers.

This is because each hexadecimal digit is stored as a `byte`

In fact, a `byte` is the `de facto standard minimum data size for memory/storage` `16m` colors is sufficient, as the human eye can only distinguish up to `10m` colors

`Math.random() * 16777216)`

The `Math.random()` method generates a number between `0 (incl)` and `1 (excl)`

Thus, the above will produce values between `0 and 16777215.999`

We then use the `Math.floor()` method to round down to nearest whole number

**incl = inclusive**

**excl = exclusive**

## Digits, bytes and hexadecimal recap

**Why bytes are important**

A bit is a `binary digit`, the smallest increment of data on a computer. It represents only 2 values - either a 0 or 1 that corresponds to the electrical values of off or on, respectively.

Because bits are so small, you hardly ever work with information one bit at a time.

So, what can we do?

`Bits` are usually assembled into a group of eight to form a `byte`.

A `byte`  is very useful for computer programmers. Why? For lots of reasons. One reason is that a `byte` contains enough information to store a single `ASCII` character, like "m" Computer storage and memory is often measured in megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB). 

The list goes on ... but for our purposes, a `byte` is most important because each hexadecimal color (RED, BLUE, GREEN) is represented by a `byte`.

**Hexadecimal Colors**

Hexadecimal color values are supported in all browsers.

And the syntax is pretty straightforward. We specify a hexadecimal color as `#RRGGBB`. We know that each hexadecimal color `(RR, GG and BB)` is defined by 8 bytes. 

Remember, each byte can represent 256 values.

This means that the hexadecimal color system can take on 256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216 values.

**ALMOST DONE**

We now have a randomly generated hex number.

Firstly, what is this `Math` object?

It is a `JavaScript` object, available to us automatically in every browser

Simple enough - we just used `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`

We now have a number result in the range of 0 and 16,777,215

`#RRGGBB`

The `toString()` method converts an object (or number) to a string

Every object has a `toString()` method

This function accepts a single optional parameter base

The base specifies how the integer should be represented in string

`num.toString(2)`

`num = 123`

Remember, Base 2 is binary (i.e. we only have 2 digits, 0 and 1)

So the above  will return 1111011

`num.toString(16)`

`num = 123`

Remember, hexadecimal is base 16 (its made up of 16 symbols)

So, the above `toString()` method will convert the 123 into hexadecimal form.

It will, in the above example, return the value `7b`

What we didn’t speak about, was that the `toString()` method can return different things, depending on which object is calling the method.

What?

In other words, the `toString()` does different things, depending on where it comes from!

Weird right.

#### Lets start at the beginning

MDN states that:

> Every object has a `toString()` method that is automatically called when the object is to be represented as a text value or when an object is referred to in a manner in which a string is expected.

In plain English: we automatically have access to the `toString()` method on pretty much everything.

#### Ok great, but what does the toString() method **actually** return

The answer depends on where it is inherited from.

Heh?

Let me explain. As MDN put it:

> If this method is not overridden in a custom object, `toString()` returns "`[object type]`".

What is this ‘type’ value? It tells us what object type we’re dealing with (for example, a Date, String, Math object, etc.).

Want an example?

Lets define a Car class, and then create a car.

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-09_17-03-07-193336831aaed94b0d67ee7dc522ff66.png?secure=MvnTGlYOr0UUvLGD5L3gXQ%3D%3D%2C1616059484)

Whats interesting about the above code is that if you call the `toString()` method on this custom object, it returns the default value inherited from the Object prototype. In other words, its telling us that our object inherits from the Object prototype.

Pretty useless for our purposes right?

We are doomed … or are we?

#### There’s an exception

By default, the `toString()` method is inherited by every object descended from Object. And unless the `toString()` method is not overridden in a custom object, `toString()` returns "`[object type]`".

The keywords here are **unless its overridden**.

Remember our example. We used the `Math.random()` method to create a random Number.

This means that we have returned to us a Number object.

#### And the good news?

The Number object overrides the `toString()` method of the Object object.

In fact, if we console out a number, we can see it has its own `toString()` method:

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-09_17-06-03-40b9b0545bbc04d3f6d79bc3001e04d8.png?secure=G43tTUk_oinOeUgg5l4XWA%3D%3D%2C1616059484)

This is different to the one inherited by the Object object. If we look at the `__proto__` of the Number object, we see it also has the `toString()` method (this is the same one we spoke about at the beginning of this article).

![img](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-09_17-06-54-fa51db2fb057a27a7ca9db9def303e2e.png?secure=3X-8F8p76wRfwLRx51WcNg%3D%3D%2C1616059484)

#### Whats my point?

We generated a random **number**.

This means that the number returned to us does *not* inherit Object.prototype.toString(). For Number objects, the toString() method returns something different.

It returns a string representation of the object in the specified *radix*.

Don't stress. The *radix* is just a fancy word for how many unique digits the numerical system has. For example, a radix of 2 would represent a binary system because the binary system only has 2 digits. A radix of 10 would represent the Decimal system because the Decimal system uses ten digits from 0 through to 9.

We used a base of 16 as the hexadecimal numerical system has 16 different types of digits.

This is why we used base 16 in our `toString()` method.

Hope this clarifies things up for you.

## Quiz

1. What is an event?

- Events are things that the happen inside the browser (such as page loading). Events are also things that the user does (like clicking a button, pressing keys, or moving a mouse). Events happen all the time in the browser.

2. Why are web events so important to master?

- Because they are everywhere in the web, and happening all the time. Web events can be fired inside the browser window, and then to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. They can happen on many items, like a single element (e.g. a <div> tag), set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are a lot of different types of events that can occur, for example a user pressing a key, or a video being played, or an error occurring.

3. Event listener and event handler are two terms that cause a lot of confusion among developers.

   What is an **event listener**?

- A listener watches for an event to be fired

4. What is an **event handler**? 

- The handler is responsible for dealing with the event, once it is fired.

5. Which 3 methods are used to add **event listeners** to the DOM? 

- The `inline event handler` , `inline properties method`, and `the event listener method.` Correct. Remember, the inline event hander method is where it all started. But be careful because this method is tedious and makes your code hard to manage. The best approach now is the event listener method - most commonly we use the addEventListener() method.

6. What is the correct way for writing the `addEventListener()` method?

- `element.addEventListener(event, handlerName)`

7. When you use the `addEventListener()` method, can the callback function be either an **anonymous** or **named** function?

   In other words, will **both** pieces of code below work? Yes

   Anonymous function:

   ```javascript
   element.addEventListener("click", () => {    
       alert("You clicked me");
   };
   ```

   Named function:

   ```javascript
   element.addEventListener("click", onClick); function onClick() {    
       alert("You clicked me");
   }
   ```

8. What is a major benefit to using the `addEventListener()` method, compared to using the other inline approaches?

- The `addEventListener()` allows you to add multiple event handlers to a single element (for example, adding multiple click events to a single element) without overwriting previously assigned event handlers. It also makes your code more manageable and structured.

9. You can add event listeners to what?

- To a ton of things. You can add event listeners to HTML DOM objects (like a <div> tag), the document object, the window object, and even other objects that support events (e.g. like the `XMLHttpRequest object`)
